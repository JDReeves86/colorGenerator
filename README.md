### About ###

---

You want colors? We got you covered. Don't know which color you want? We got you. Want a series of colors that blend together well and synergize to create that killer palette that will drop jaws? We probably don't got you.

It's a random color generator, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. My first project built on my own using concepts learned through independent study. It was a way to practice understanding how the Math.random function works and how to iterate over arrays to build output. I added a really basic UI for interaction to demonstrate proof of concept and not much else.
